                <p>The unique value of the “authentic” work of art has its basis in ritual, the location of its original use value.</p>
                <p>But the instant the criterion of authenticity ceases to be applicable to artistic production, the total function of art is reversed. Instead of being based on ritual, it begins to be based on another practice – politics.</p>
                <p>When the age of mechanical reproduction separated art from its basis in the cult, the semblance of its autonomy disappeared forever.</p>

                <p>the first choice was that you were starting in a forest only with a knight riding a dark horse</p>
                <p>his flag was red</p>
                <p>and then you could reach a friendly town</p>

                <p>Anyway, the game pretty much starts off with a robot girl being woken up by a human boy in a huge rundown facility. They attempt to leave but some bad guys try to stop them. They manage to escape and begin traveling together. The boy seems to hate her very much, yet seems to know her. They end up travelling to some kind of town or city and while there the boy gets hurt. They meet up with other people there. These people consist of: two men in their early 20's, a young boy who is into gaming, a plant boy, an invisible guy and a stern looking woman. There might be another but if so, I forget. One night that she is there, she overhears the woman talking to one of the men about her. They say something about her being a murderer. You can then choose if she stays there or leaves them. Then the demo ends there.</p>

                <p>There was a female cat character who guided you through the activities and made bad puns that varied from one activity to the next. Each activity had a specific theme in addition to the subject it taught: the first one taught patterns and the theme was a prairie cottage/house where you used shapes to make quilt patterns, another was an alpine ski resort teaching multiplication where you solved problems with cows in balloons and hang gliders, another area was an eastern bazaar where you balanced scales to teach solving for variables, etc. There was also a part where you made smoothies/juice for a toucan.</p>

                <br />
                <p>i remember 3 weapons used in the game:</p>
                <br />
                <p>1 darts,</p>
                <p>2 a yellow ball,</p> 
                <p>3 a straw-like blowgun;</p>
                <br />
                <p>another thing i remember is that one of the tests to become a wizard is located inside a observatory-like place in a rocky island, and the path inside the observatory is invisible.</p>
                <br />
                <p>the game was an adventure-puzzle fantasy game.</p>
                <br />
                <p>if i am not mistaken you were becoming a magician to save your girlfriend who is dressed in pink.</p>

                <p>The game, I have been trying to remember is quiet old around anywhere from 2000-2005. All I can remember is a monster killing a guy for a crown. I think the guy fell off a platform while trying to run away.</p>
                <br />
                <p>I think it was an alien that killed the guy with the crown. He fell off a ledge or something. Someone please help?</p>

                <p>First of all, greetings and salutations everyone.</p>
                <p>Now, what I'm searching for is a pc point and click game I used to play in the 2000s though I suspect it was a tad older than that</p>
                <br />
                <p>What I can remember is this:</p>
                <br />
                <p>you where the last human male alive</p>
                <p>the game starts with your space ship crashing on a primitive planet;</p>
                <p>you encounter a woman in a shack</p>
                <p>that doesn't believe you're a man</p>
                <p>and asks you something along the lines of:</p>
                <br />
                <p>-Where does the fork go on the table</p>
                <br />
                <p>(to which the correct reply would be)</p>
                <br />
                <p>-Where ever it lands after I throw it.</p>
                <br />
                <p>she then believes you</p>
                <p>and your perspective changes to that of a monitor</p>
                <p>where more women see you</p>
                <p>they decide to capture you</p>
                <br />

              <div class="text-left n2">
                <p>one of the first puzzles in the game involves a sack of pears;</p>
                <p>you lay some leaves on a hole put the pear there</p>
                <p>and afterwards a very large woman comes jumping from the background</p>
                <p>to eat the pear of course she gets stuck in the hole</p>
                <br />
                <p>You are later captured on a spaceship</p>
                <p>your cell is empty</p>
                <p>but you do have the option to talk to the cell wall</p>
                <p>on the other side being another male</p>
                <p>of alien origin</p>
                <br />
                <p>from your so called cell mate</p>
                <p>you learn that all the males have been eradicated</p>
                <p>and that the women on board the vessel</p>
                <p>are collecting the last male</p>
                <p>from every species in the galaxy/universe</p>
                <br />
                <p>you then go through the vent of the cell</p>
                <p>arrive at a command console with lots of monitors</p>
                <p>you proceed to open the alien cell</p>
                <p>when that happens</p>
                <p>a woman points a laser blaster at you</p>
                <p>asks what you are doing you reply something like</p>
                <p>"I was just admiring this half eaten doughnut"</p>

                <p>At some point you arrive on an all female planet</p>

                <br />
                <p>after that you find a sex change machine</p>
                <br />
                <p>you also get to a male only planet</p>
                <p>which is desolate</p>
                <br />
                <p>here you find a space ship to get off the planet</p>
                <p>at this point you can end the game</p>
                <p>but because the glass of the ship is cracked</p>
                <p>your head explodes in space</p>
                <p>so you have the option to glue the crack</p>
                <p>but then you can't leave</p>
                <p>because your character has an obsession</p>
                <p>with getting a precious vase</p>

                <p>is off limits</p>

                <p>You started out in a town where you had to figure out why you were there, and you had lost your memory. I remember there being a broken down car and a house which you entered and could explore.</p>
                <br />
                <p>I remember you started out in a town and you had to figure out a way across a bridge that was closed and you went inside a house.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Also in one house you learned about the people that lived there through pictures left behind I think. At the end of the game you find a person in the town in a church and end up finding out everyone has been raptured or died unexpectedly.</p>
                <br />
                <p>Also the game was heavily influenced by Christianity hence the rapture idea. The end of the game had in the menu you could email the game developer with questions about Christianity or anything in general, also it had bible verses i think.</p>

                <p>i used to play a game where you would</p>
                <p>hatch gremlins from eggs</p>
                <p>name, and raise them</p>
                <p>and you could hold there hand to walk them places</p>
                <p>you could ride a skateboard</p>
                <p>take them gardening</p>
                <p>to the dungeon to explore</p>
                <p>to this sky machine building thing</p>
                <p>and back down to slide on a giant tree with a face</p>
                <p>and you could go home and bake cakes for them to eat with what you found outside</p>
                <p>and when they got sick you would ring a bell</p>
                <p>and a horse would come and bring a machine</p>
                <p>where they would step inside for awhile</p>
                <p>and come back out all better</p>
                <br />
                <p>the gremlins would lay eggs randomly i think and when you clicked on them</p>
                <p>they would get sent by a bird to your homes incubator</p>
                <br />
                <p>and when your current gremlin grew old and died</p>
                <p>he would walk himself to the graveyard</p>
                <br />
                <p>i think i don't remember too much</p>
                <p>but there would be a stone with their name on it</p>
