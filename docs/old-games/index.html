                <p>The unique value of the “authentic” work of art has its basis in ritual, the location of its original use value.</p><br/>
                <p>But the instant the criterion of authenticity ceases to be applicable to artistic production, the total function of art is reversed. Instead of being based on ritual, it begins to be based on another practice – politics.</p><br/>
                <p>When the age of mechanical reproduction separated art from its basis in the cult, the semblance of its autonomy disappeared forever.</p><br/>

                <p>It had kind of a dark theme to it. I remember something about a magic ring that was hard to find, and the best clue is that it had a magic carpet and some kind of lava section or level that you had to navigate with the carpet. That part especially was very challenging (or seemed at the time) and I died a lot</p>

                <p>Could you guys help me find the name of a game that required you to collect crystals/diamonds? It was a game similar to supaplex in a way because the crystals/diamonds were trapped. You had to arrange some of the oval blocks in such way that it blew up the barrier and gave you access to the crystals/diamonds.</p>
                <p>Now, there was a dot that moved all on the edges on the path I made (like in supaplex the grass was mowned everywhere I walked). All I had to figure out where to move and how to move the oval blocks in order for the dot to move on the specific edge and make the barries blows up & I collect my crystals/diamonds.</p>
                <p><b>The whole setting was in a black or cosmic surrounding.</b></p>

                <p>There was a medieval RTS game like Age of Empires where you could play a campaign (i think). If I remember corectly there were 2 or 3 choises - the first choice was that you were starting in a forest only with a knight riding a dark horse, his flag was red and then you could reach a friendly town having the flag color in very light blue and that town was having an air baloon flying over the town, and the peasants or constructors were wearing white with brown pants (i think). The 2nd choice was starting in a medieval town that you could control, the peasants or constructors were wearing grey with red and they were automatically collecting seeds, and then after a while you would be attacked by another faction. The 3rd choice (here im not sure) you would start with a knight on a white horse, the horse couldnt walk, only run, and the knight color orange and the place where you would start was in a destroyed village only with a few peasants remained....</p>

                <p>The plot was around a strange fog that has covered all the land (or village?) slowly killings people, animals and plant. You start your desperate quest to solve the mistery of this fog.</p>
                <p>- The very first scene of the game is at the entrance of an abandoned village (abandoned or with ghostly villagers). </p>

                <p>I remember you controlled a guy in a 3D home or office, but I don't remember if it was first or third person. You could open doors, and interact with objects like cabinets, sink?, bed, just home furniture.</p>
                <p>I think it was some kind of escape the room but I'm not sure.</p>

                <p>There was a female cat character who guided you through the activities and made bad puns that varied from one activity to the next. Each activity had a specific theme in addition to the subject it taught: the first one taught patterns and the theme was a prairie cottage/house where you used shapes to make quilt patterns, another was an alpine ski resort teaching multiplication where you solved problems with cows in balloons and hang gliders, another area was an eastern bazaar where you balanced scales to teach solving for variables, etc." There was also a part where you made smoothies/juice for a toucan?</p>

                <p>Firs of all, greetings and salutations everyone.</p>
                <p>Now, what I'm searching for is a pc point and click game, I used to play in the 2000s, though I suspect it was a tad older than that.What I can remember is this:</p>
                <p>-you where the last human male alive, the game starts with your space ship crashing on a primitive planet;</p>
                <p>-you encounter a woman in a shack that doesn't believe you're a man and asks you something along the lines of:</p>
                <p>-Where does the fork go on the table</p>
                <p>(to which the correct reply would be)</p>
                <p>-Where ever it lands after I throw it.</p>
                <p>-she then believes you and your perspective changes to that of a monitor where more women see you they decide to capture you(kind of like a cutscene)</p>
                <p>-one of the first puzzles in the game involves a sack of pears you lay some leaves on a hole put the pear there and afterwards a very large woman comes jumping from the background to eat the pear of course she gets stuck in the hole.</p>
                <p>-you are later captured on a space ship your cell is empty but you do have the option to talk to the cell wall on the other side being another male of alien origin</p>
                <p>-from your so called cell mate you learn that all the males have been eradicated and that the women on board the vessel are collecting the last male from every species in the galaxy/universe.</p>
                <p>-you than go through the went of the cell arrive at a command console with lots of monitors you proceed to open the alien cell when that happens a woman points a laser blaster at you asks what you are doing you reply something like "I was just admiring this half eaten doughnut" she then gets splatted to the wall by your friend who proceed to the teleporter to get to his own planet.</p>
                <p>-at some point your arrive on an all female planet and if you try to go any further some lasers and saws kill you after that you find a sex change machine.</p>
                <p>-you also get to a male only planet which is desolate here you find a space ship to get of the planet at this point you can end the game but because the glass of the ship is cracked your head explodes in space</p>
                <p>-so you have the option to glue the crack but then you can't leave because your character has an obsession with getting a precious vase from the mayor's office(insurance purposes) which if I remember correctly is off limits because of the lava.</p>
                <p>That's about it i never did finish it don't know if it was made by lucasarts but I think with all the details I've given it should go smoothly.</p>
                <p>P.S sorry for the lack of commas and thank you for straining your eyes reading this block of text</p>

                <p>hi people i am looking for a game i played around 1995 and 2001.</p>
                <p>3D game it develops mostly in the desert, the main character is dressed in blue (i think with a red belt and a pony-tail) and trying to become a wizard/magician, i remember 3 weapons used in the game: 1 darts, 2 a yellow ball, 3 a straw-like blowgun; another thing i remember is that one of the tests to become a wizard is located inside a observatory-like place in a rocky island, and the path inside the observatory is invisible. the game was an adventure-puzzle fantasy game. if i am not mistaken you were becoming a magician to save your girlfriend who is dressed in pink.</p>
                <p>Thanks a lot</p>

                <p>I'm looking for an older game that i played on PC back in 2000-2004(i think)</p>
                <p>It is an RPG or JRPG, it had turnbased comba, 2D, top down and looked like a Final Fantasy game</p>
                <p>U played as a boy and a girl (not sure about the girl) and i think the boy had blue hair</p>
                <p>U started in some sort of village and i remember that one of the first quest was that u had to investigate a storage room or something because something went missing(a ring maybe) and in that room there was a lots of barrels or crates and u had to move one of them to reveal a ladder down. When u got down the ladder u found the thief and u started chasing him</p>
                <p>Please help, i'm searching for the game for a long time</p>

                <p>im looking for a super old pc game i used to play that was like a build your own kingdom game but after building it you could walk around in first person view and look around the kingdom you just made with a few npc you cant interact with but only like a king and a random civilian it was only blocks and triagular shapes, and you could edit the land which was one big square since i think it was on a very old windows version like 95 or the one after that, it was in the early 2000s when I played it</p>
