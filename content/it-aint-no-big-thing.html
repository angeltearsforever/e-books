                <p>I'm standing in line at the Silverlake Gelson's. I have beat-up white cowboy boots on with shorts. I'm watching the Trader Joe's across the street where a group of about 50 demonstrators are ending a march to demand justice for Mely Corado. They're all holding sunflowers. A voice comes over a loudspeaker: "I asked Mayor Garcetti to be here. Is he here? Is he? No. No, I don't think he is here." The demonstrators starts to boo and chant "Fuck Garcetti." I check to make sure my feet are on the red line of tape that marks where to stand in order to not infect each other with our breathing. I imagine a morning shift produce clerk kneeling down to stretch the tape across the ground at 5AM. My boots cut the red line exactly down the middle. It's 80 degrees and we're in full sun. The inside of my mask has its own tropical weather pattern.</p>
                <p>The two men in front of me are not wearing masks. I watch as they banter back and forth and laugh and spread their saliva everywhere. Finally one of them (the one with the ponytail) reaches into a tote bag and pulls out a roll of gauze. Casually, as he continues to speak, he unrolls some of it, cuts it with a swiss army knife from his back pocket, and hands the strip to his friend. Then he does the same for himself. They tie the gauze around their mouths, reaching their hands behind their heads in an effort to make knots. I have a sudden vision of them as children trying to tie their shoes. You can see their mouths still moving through the texture of the gauze and it is grotesque. They already look like patients.</p>

                <p>Semiotically speaking, masks are a technique for transforming or temporarily extinguishing the representation of an ego-based identity. If this definition is true, social media is a mask, getting dressed is a mask, jobs are a mask, drugs are a mask. This isn't a new connection. Here in America we're constantly engaged in 'impression management'; constantly aware of our 'selves' as separate entities that we can use, sell, and buy. We are basically the world experts of wearing masks. Is it actually surprising that we seem to be wrestling a nation-wide mask-fueled ego crisis? Kind of. We all still seem to be in shock.</p>

                <p>Our collective human narrative is wavering behind us, a darkly transparent blob like a Miyazaki forest spirit's insides, like a long living shadow. It's coming out of all of us at once. It marks the outline of our cumulative shape. Paul Valéry wrote: "the abyss of history" is deep enough to hold us all."</p>

                <p>Everything counts. Even if it is for not much.</p>
                <p>For those who "aspire" to the "American Dream" of "again" and "before" and "used to be", the system remains an almost religious way of life. It provides illusory comfort, which dies extremely slowly. There’s a grieving process: denial, anger, bargaining, depression. The brave and optimistic among us call this healing.</p>

                <p>I've been in the Gelson's line for 10 minutes now. The protest across the street has dissipated, and all that's left is a news camera crew interviewing a beaming organizer and a row of bright sunflowers wilting against the brick wall. In the sudden relative quiet I hear the man in front of the two gauze men turn around and say: "Could you back up, pal?"</p>
                <p>There's a pause. Ponytail man is feigning shock. "Excuse me?" As he says it, the knot he tied at the back of his head comes loose and the gauze falls down. He tries to put it back. His friend also looks surprised. "We're standing on the red line, and we're not going anywhere."</p> 
                <p>Now the man ahead turns fully around. He works out a lot. "What did you say to me, you little punk ass bitch?"</p>
                <p>I'm trying to think. If these guys do back up, then I need to back up and I hope the people behind me will all back up ~ and if these guys don't back up, are they going to fight?</p>

                <p>I see a tweet or a meme or a caption, I can't quite remember, circulating on social media. I think about it a lot. This is what it says, more or less: "America should make the pandemic a game. The state with the least new cases and deaths gets free pizza all month. This would, unfortunately, work extremely well."</p>

                <p>Ego identity allows individuals to experience and enact their sense of <i>who they are</i> with chronology and sameness. It’s a means for continuity of the person.</p>
                <p>Continuity is an interesting thing to contemplate. What has really ever been continuous? I suppose everything is continuous, but does not necessarily act with continuity. Chronology is not real. America is not real.</p>
                <p>Sometimes I imagine myself running through a wild meadow totally and completely naked. It’s dusk, and there are fireflies and wildflowers and gentle deer everywhere. Depending on the day, this vision makes me feel 1. beautiful and free, my hair whipping behind me as I laugh into the navy blue sky, or 2. insanely lonely, screaming into the void.</p>

                <p>Ponytail man has let his gauze simply fall to the sidewalk. He is now inches away from the guy who is ahead in line. His friend stands behind them, saying: "This is what the red lines are for. Can you guys please just look. It says right on them that we are already Socially Distancing." The intensity of the stares between the two men seems to have a physical weight that hangs like a dead bell in the heat.</p>

                <p>When I was 28 in Western Massachusetts and it was mid-summer, which is all sticky and loud with bugs, I wrote a pretty bad poem with this as the last line: Is it better to live, or to know you are living?</p>
                <p>I've tried ever since to use it again and I've never been able to do it successfully. I'm not even sure if it fits here.</p>

                <p>With my mask on, beyond knowing that everyone is safer, do I feel like I'm gaining some kind of small privacy back? Does wearing a mask in public at all times provide me and my ego a break? It’s like one of us got called to work in a new city and we’re suddenly in a long-distance relationship. It would be silly to continue on with it.</p> 
                <p>The wind shifts a little, and the line finally moves again. Neither man says anything. No one says anything. The friend has already cut another piece of gauze for Ponytail man as he arrives to stand once more on his designated red line. He ties it around his face, muttering. Then he turns to me and says, apologetically: "You should mind your own fucking business little girl."</p>
