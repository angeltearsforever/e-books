                <p>The unique value of the “authentic” work of art has its basis in ritual, the location of its original use value.</p><br/>
                <p>But the instant the criterion of authenticity ceases to be applicable to artistic production, the total function of art is reversed. Instead of being based on ritual, it begins to be based on another practice – politics.</p><br/>
                <p>When the age of mechanical reproduction separated art from its basis in the cult, the semblance of its autonomy disappeared forever.</p><br/>

                <p>If your character is killed, you become a skeleton. You can continue to play, but you're more vulnerable, and I don't remember if you're able to become alive again. If you die as a skeleton, I believe it was game over.</p>

                <p>I don't know if it's an apartment building or a hotel you are in but you can go in elevators I think and walk around. You have to go to work and scan your finger on a fingerprint scanner. I think the corporation you work for is bad and owns the building you live in. I think you can fall out a window to your death or something...maybe not.. This is really hard to remember lol... there's a robot lady voice and you can use an atm type thing</p>

                <p>It had kind of a dark theme to it. I remember something about a magic ring that was hard to find, and the best clue is that it had a magic carpet and some kind of lava section or level that you had to navigate with the carpet. That part especially was very challenging (or seemed at the time) and I died a lot</p>

                <p>Could you guys help me find the name of a game that required you to collect crystals/diamonds? It was a game similar to supaplex in a way because the crystals/diamonds were trapped. You had to arrange some of the oval blocks in such way that it blew up the barrier and gave you access to the crystals/diamonds.</p>
                <p>Now, there was a dot that moved all on the edges on the path I made (like in supaplex the grass was mowned everywhere I walked). All I had to figure out where to move and how to move the oval blocks in order for the dot to move on the specific edge and make the barries blows up & I collect my crystals/diamonds.</p>
                <p><b>The whole setting was in a black or cosmic surrounding.</b></p>

                <p>There was a medieval RTS game like Age of Empires where you could play a campaign (i think). If I remember corectly there were 2 or 3 choises - the first choice was that you were starting in a forest only with a knight riding a dark horse, his flag was red and then you could reach a friendly town having the flag color in very light blue and that town was having an air baloon flying over the town, and the peasants or constructors were wearing white with brown pants (i think). The 2nd choice was starting in a medieval town that you could control, the peasants or constructors were wearing grey with red and they were automatically collecting seeds, and then after a while you would be attacked by another faction. The 3rd choice (here im not sure) you would start with a knight on a white horse, the horse couldnt walk, only run, and the knight color orange and the place where you would start was in a destroyed village only with a few peasants remained....</p>

                <p>The plot was around a strange fog that has covered all the land (or village?) slowly killings people, animals and plant. You start your desperate quest to solve the mistery of this fog.</p>
                <p>- The very first scene of the game is at the entrance of an abandoned village (abandoned or with ghostly villagers). </p>

                <p>I played it on my dad's PC like 18/20 years ago and I think it was some kinda of demo, because I (as a little kid) could never progress.</p>
                <p>I remember you controlled a guy in a 3D home or office, but I don't remember if it was first or third person. You could open doors, and interact with objects like cabinets, sink?, bed, just home furniture.</p>
                <p>I think it was some kind of escape the room but I'm not sure.</p>

                <p>Im going crazy, please help me remember, it was a PC 3rd person shooter game, it was a girl in a black tight suit, she hada gun embedded into her hand (Metroid like) and looked kind of arcady, you could use a parachute that looked funny.<p>

                <p>There was a female cat character who guided you through the activities and made bad puns that varied from one activity to the next. Each activity had a specific theme in addition to the subject it taught: the first one taught patterns and the theme was a prairie cottage/house where you used shapes to make quilt patterns, another was an alpine ski resort teaching multiplication where you solved problems with cows in balloons and hang gliders, another area was an eastern bazaar where you balanced scales to teach solving for variables, etc." There was also a part where you made smoothies/juice for a toucan?</p>

                <p>3D game it develops mostly in the desert, the main character is dressed in blue (i think with a red belt and a pony-tail) and trying to become a wizard/magician, i remember 3 weapons used in the game: 1 darts, 2 a yellow ball, 3 a straw-like blowgun; another thing i remember is that one of the tests to become a wizard is located inside a observatory-like place in a rocky island, and the path inside the observatory is invisible. the game was an adventure-puzzle fantasy game. if i am not mistaken you were becoming a magician to save your girlfriend who is dressed in pink.</p>
