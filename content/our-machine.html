                  <p>Ashley Chambers and Nora Hughes met for the first time on February 3, 2021 in Whatcom County, Washington. They went for an evening stroll through an industrial marina and discovered a large machine. This machine was illuminated so sublimely against the dark as if to beckon them upon it, and the two soon discovered that it would offer further instruction. “Our Machine i-iii” represent the first chapters of an ongoing process of discovery and documentation.</p>

                  <p><b>Nora Hughes</b> is an artist and educator living on the unceded land of the Laq'temish (Lummi) Nation and the Nuxwsa'7aq (Nooksack) tribe.

                  <p><b>Casey Proctor</b> is a songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, recording engineer and producer currently living in Carrboro, NC. Originally hailing from the Pacific Northwest, she trained as a classical pianist from age 5 then moved into various genre modes during her college years. Her ventures include ‘Rosehips,’ a psych-folk dream-pop duo with Nora Hughes that pulls small pieces from old timey country and 70’s drone, and ‘Haruspex Palace,’ a solo project in which she plays, records, and produces each genre-coalescing song to her vision. As a session musician, Proctor’s playing can be heard on Holy Sons latest release ‘Raw and Disfigured’ on Thrill Jockey Records. She is currently working on new records, as well as collaborating with performance artists and filmmakers on scores and soundtracks for upcoming releases.</p>
